/*
 * classrooms array
 *
 * Classrooms are stored in array as objects. Classroom Objects have a
 *building, a room number, and available times stored under building,
 *room, and times respectively.
 *
 *The times member is a 7 element array of arrays.
 *times[0] corresponds to sunday. The subarrays of times
 *correspond to available classroom times.
 *
 *So if we had times[3] = [8,17] that would correspond to
 *the classroom being open on wednesday at 8AM and 5PM. 
 *We use an empty subarray to denote the classroom being
 *used from 8AM to 6PM.
 *
 * We also consider all classrooms to be open after 6PM
 * and do not store those times.

# UCLA Classroom Availability

This simple program displays currently available classrooms at UCLA. Classrooms displayed are from a small local database within the project files and are added manually. Classrooms available in the next hour are also displayed.

This was developed mainly to expirement with the GitHub pages functionality and to learn simple javascript and HTML.
